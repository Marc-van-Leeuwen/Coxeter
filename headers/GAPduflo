##
## It contains the allocation to the variable coxeter_duflo of the list
## of all Duflo involutions in the current group, together with the
## corresponding Kazhdan-Lusztig polynomials P_{e,d} (recall that a
## Duflo involution d is the unique element in its left cell for which
## l(d) - 2 deg(P_{e,d}) is minimal.)
##
## The involutions are output in the same order as the left cells are
## output by the "lcells" command.
