#
# This file contains the list of the W-graphs for the various Kazhdan-Lusztig
# cells in the group. Each cell is sorted w.r.t the shortlex normal form order
# (for the ordering of the generators which was current when this file was
# created) and the cells are written in the order of their first elements.
#
# First we print the lists of the descent sets for the various nodes of the
# graphs. We output one line per graph, and on each line a comma-separated
# set of lists of the form (*,*,...,*) where the * are the descent generators.
#
# Then we print the list of edge-lists, again one line per graph. There is
# one edge-list per node of the graph; it is a brace-enclosed, comma-separated
# list of pairs (destination,mu) where destination is the destination of
# the edge, represented by the index number of the destination node, starting
# from zero, in the node numbering that we use, and mu is the corresponding
# mu-coefficient.
#
# The two lists are separated by a comment line saying "edge lists", to
# make parsing easier.
