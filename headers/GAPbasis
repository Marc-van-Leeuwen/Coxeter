## Let H := Hecke(W,u^2,u) be the Hecke algebra of our group, where u is
## a square root of our indeterminate q. Then this file contains one GAP
## instruction, the assignment to the variable coxeter_cbasis of what would be
## the GAP output to the call t(c(w)) in Chevie, where w is our element (which
## can be read as the last term in the file), t is u^{-l(w)}T(w), where
## T := Basis(H,"T") is the ordinary basis of the Hecke algebra, and
## c := Basis(H,"C'") is what was called the C'-basis in the original
## Kazhdan-Lusztig paper.
##
## The coefficients are shifted as they should, and are therefore polynomials
## in the negative powers of the indeterminate u. The powers that come up are
## either all even or all odd.
