## This file contains the allocation to the variable coxeter_sstratification
## of the list of pairs [elt,pol], where elt runs through the maximal
## elements of the sets of x < y with a given k-l polynomial != 1; pol is
## the correswponding k-l polynomial. In the case where W is crystallographic,
## these are the irreducible components of the the "rational singular
## stratification" of the Schubert variety X_y, where P_{x,y} is used as a
## measure of the severity of the singularity along the subvariety defined by
## x. It is known that in this case, P_{x,y} is a decreasing function of x.

## NOTE : the ordering of the printout is inverse to the one used in Goresky's
## files.
