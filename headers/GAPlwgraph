## It contains the allocation to the variable coxeter_lwgraph of the
## full left W-graph of the current context. This is guaranteed to be a
## W-graph only when the current context is the full group context;
## otherwise it is the user's responsibility either to ensure that he
## is dealing with a context which is a union of left cells, or to
## get what he can from the partial graph.
##
## In order to be consistent with our other output, we have sorted the
## group elements in shortlex order for the Bourbaki ordering of the
## generators.
##
## For convenience we allocate the enumeration to the variable
## coxeter_contextEnumeration.
##
## The W-graph is represented as a list of pairs [descent set, edge-list],
## one for each element on the context. The descent set is just the list of
## left descents of the element; the edge-list is a list of pairs
## [destination,mu], where mu is the mu-coefficient, and destination is
## the destination of the edge, represented as a number in the enumeration
## of the context that we use (indices start from 1, to be consistent with
## GAP usage.)
