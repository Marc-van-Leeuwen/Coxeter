# It contains the order relation on the left cells, inherited from the
# preorder relation <=_L on the group. What we output is the hasse diagram
# of this ordering (or rather of the dual ordering) : for each cell, we
# print the list of cells that lie immediately above it (recall that {e} is
# the *largest* element in the left cell ordering.) As always, cells are
# represented by their index number in the list which is output by lcells;
# in this file, we produce the abstract ordering on the integers {0, ..., N-1},
# where N is the number of left cells.
#
# Note that the enumeration ordering we use on cells is not compatible with
# the (reversed) left cell ordering, in the sense that edges in our hasse
# diagram do not always go to elements with a smaller index. It would be
# possible to re-sort the cells so that this would be true, but we have
# refrained from doing that for the sake of consistency.
#
# We output one edge-list per line, as a comma-separated list; the first line
# is an empty list, as it should be!
