#
# Polynomials are represented in dense representation, as a list of
# coefficients, starting with the coefficient in degree zero. Lists
# are comma-separated and enclosed in parentheses. Polynomials may
# be preceded by a modifier of the form (d,m); this means that X^d
# has to be substituted in the polynomial, and that the result should
# be multiplied by X^m; in particular, this is how Laurent polynomials
# are obtained. An absent modifier is equivalent to the modifier (1,0).
#
# The file contains the data for one element c_y of the Kazhdan-Lusztig
# c-basis (denoted C' in the original KL paper) of the Hecke algebra
# of the group. The coefficients in this basis are polynomials in the
# indeterminate u = q^{-1/2}; but after an appropriate shift they become
# polynomials in q. Therefore they can be compactly represented with
# a modifier of the form (2,-m), m >= 0. We print out one line for
# each x <= y in the Bruhat ordering; the line contains the element x,
# followed by : and the corresponding polynomial. To find out the value
# of y, look at the last line. The elements x are sorted in the shortlex
# ordering corresponding to the ordering of generators which was current
# when this file was created.
