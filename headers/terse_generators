#
# Generators in the group are represented by decimal numbers 1,2, ... ; the
# ordering of the generators is the current ordering. Unless you have changed
# that, the format for outputting group elements as words is the same as for
# GAP, viz. prefix "[", separator ",", postfix "]"; so for instance a word in
# three generators that would be written as 12321 in our usual "really terse"
# style will be written here as [1,2,3,2,1].
