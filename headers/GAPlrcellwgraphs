## This file contains the list of the W-graphs for the various two-sided
## Kazhdan-Lusztig cells in the group. Each cell is sorted w.r.t the shortlex
## normal form order (for the natural ordering of the generators used in GAP,
## unless you have changed that), and the cells are written in the order of
## their first elements.
##
## The file contains the allocation to the variable coxeter_lrcwgraphs of a
## list of W-graphs, one for each two-sided cell, which are output as the for
## the full two-sided W-graph of the group, viz. as a list of pairs
## [descent set, edge list], one pair for each node in the cell. The descent
## set is a pair [right descent set, left descent set]; the edge-list is again
## a list of pairs [dest,mu], where dest is the destination node of the edge,
## and mu the corresponding mu-coefficient. Nodes are numbered from 1, as is
## customary in GAP.
