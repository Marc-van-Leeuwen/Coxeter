# For each polynomial P != 1 which occurs among the P_{x,y}, x < y, we
# print out the maximal elements in the set of x < y s.t. P_{x,y} = P,
# together with the corresponding k-l polynomial. In the case where
# W is crystallographic, these are the irreducible components of the
# the "rational singular stratification" of the Schubert variety X_y,
# where P_{x,y} is used as a measure of the severity of the singularity
# along the subvariety defined by x. It is known that in this case,
# P_{x,y} is a decreasing function of x.
#
# Generators in the group are represented by decimal numbers 1,2, ... ;
# the format for outputting group elements as words is the same as for
# GAP, viz. prefix "[", separator ",", postfix "]"; so for instance a word
# in three generators that would be written as 12321 in our usual "really
# terse" style will be written here as [1,2,3,2,1].
#
# Polynomials are represented in dense representation, as a list of
# coefficients, starting with the coefficient in degree zero. Lists
# are comma-separated and enclosed in parentheses. Polynomials may
# be preceded by a modifier of the form (d,m); this means that X^d
# has to be substituted in the polynomial, and that the result should
# be multiplied by X^m; in particular, this is how Laurent polynomials
# are obtained. An absent modifier is equivalent to the modifier (1,0).
