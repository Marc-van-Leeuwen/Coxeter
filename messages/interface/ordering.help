The command "ordering" allows you to change the ordering of the generators.
This does not change the way the program deals with the group internally;
it only affects the output, and the definition of ShortLex normal forms, for
instance.

One should not confuse the ordering of the generators, and the symbols
which are attached to them (this can be a little bit confusing when the
symbols themselves are labels like "1", "2", etc.) We have taken the approach
that symbols are attached to actual generators; changing the ordering does
not affect the correspondence. This makes it easy, for instance, to see how
normal forms change when the ordering is changed.
