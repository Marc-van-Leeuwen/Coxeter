The "gap" command sets output conventions to GAP style. This means first of
all that Bourbaki conventions are adopted (see the help message for the
"bourbaki" command.) Futher, decimal generator symbols are set, and
prefix, separator, and postfix are set respectively to "[", ",", "]", so
that for instance an element denoted 12321 in our standard notation becomes
[1,2,3,2,1].

Furthermore, all output to files is done in such a way that the corresponding
files are directly legible by GAP3, and contain legal definitions of GAP
objects. This sets up a rudimentary communication protocol between GAP and
Coxeter.
