The "terse" command sets i/o conventions to terse style. This style is
meant to produce output that is easily parsed by computer. Decimal generator
symbols are adopted, with GAP-style representation of words, and a string-
representation of polynomials is adopted as well, without an explicit
indeterminate. The ordering of the generators is left untouched, and can
be set separately by the user, if so desired.

Output files in the terse style usually contain a number of comment-lines,
starting with the # symbol, which explain the contents and the format of
the file; that way, the file should be usable without having to look at
this help message.
