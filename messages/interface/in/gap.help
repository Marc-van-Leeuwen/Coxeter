The "gap" command sets input conventions to GAP style. This means first of
all that Bourbaki conventions are adopted (see the help message for the
"bourbaki" command.) Futher, decimal generator symbols are set, and
prefix, separator, and postfix are set respectively to "[", ",", "]", so
that for instance an element denoted 12321 in our standard notation becomes
[1,2,3,2,1].
