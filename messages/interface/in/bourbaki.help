The "bourbaki" command sets input conventions to Bourbaki. This means that the
default ordering of the generators in types B and D is reversed from our
usual choice; nothing is changed for the other types. In order to have output
which is not too confusing, and which is consistent with other programs that
adopt Bourbaki conventions, such as GAP, we also permute the generator
symbols; usually they are attributed in the natural ordering of the vertices,
so the effect is an increasing labelling of the generators in the new
enumeration.
