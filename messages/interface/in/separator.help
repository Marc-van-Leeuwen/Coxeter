The separator command allows you to reset the input separator. The separator
may be an arbitrary string, including the empty string, but may not start
with white space. In addition, all the strings of the input interface must be
distinct. The empty string is likely to cause problems when the generator
symbols have embeddings (e.g. if 1, 2, and 12 are all three input symbols, then
with empty separator the string 12 will always be parsed as the single
generator 12, never as 1 times 2.) However, white space in input will always
act as a separator, so you could still enter 1 2 in that case.
