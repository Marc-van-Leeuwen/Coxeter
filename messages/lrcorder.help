The command "lrcorder" prints out the ordering of the two-sided cells for
the current group. This is by definition the ordered set associated to the
W-graph seen as an oriented graph.

The output file contains a printout of the (dual) Hasse diagram of the
"abstract" poset, in the numbering of the vertices obtained by ordering
the cells in the shortLex order of their shortLex-smallest elements, for
the shortLex order corresponding to the current ordering of the vertices.
