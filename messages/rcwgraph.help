The "rcwgraphs" command prints out the W-graphs of the right cells in the
group. The cells are sorted in ShortLex order (for the current ordering of
the generators); this is the order in which they are output by the "rcells"
command.

In the default output mode, the W-graphs in the following format : first
we output the descents sets for each node in each cell, one line per cell;
then, for each of the cells, in increasing order, we output one line per
vertex of the cell, containing a list of pairs (e;mu), one for each edge
originating from that vertex, where e is the extremity of the edge, and
mu is the corresponding mu-coefficient. The file-output formats will
include comments in their files explaining the output format which is used.
