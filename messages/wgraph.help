The "wgraph" command prints out the W-graph of the group, numbered as always
in the ordering described in the help message for "lcells". For each node
in the graph, we print out the edges in the edges in the graph originating
from that node, together with the corresponding mu-coefficient.

This function will give a correct answer only if the full mu-table for the
group has been computed. Because this is of interest for further
investigations, we allow the command to be called also for infinite, or
partially filled, groups, even though the result is not then an actual
W-graph in general.
