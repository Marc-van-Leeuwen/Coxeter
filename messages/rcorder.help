The command "rcorder" prints out the ordering of the right cells for the
current group. This is by definition the ordered set associated to the
W-graph seen as an oriented graph; recall that if the group is a finite Weyl
group, this is also the poset of primitive ideals with trivial central
character of the universal enveloping algebra of the corresponding semisimple
Lie algebra.

The output file contains a printout of the (dual) Hasse diagram of the
"abstract" poset, in the numbering of the vertices obtained by ordering
the cells in the shortLex order of their shortLex-smallest elements, for
the shortLex order corresponding to the current ordering of the vertices.
