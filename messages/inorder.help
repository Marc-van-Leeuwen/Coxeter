The "inorder" command compares two elements in the group, using only elementary
string operations (and hence not consuming any memory). The algorithm is as
follows : let s be a generator s.t. hs < h; then if gs < g, g<=h iff gs<=hs;
otherwise g<=h iff g<=hs. Of course this is very slow and not suitable for
large-scale computations.

If the comparison is true, the program will indicate the set of erasure points
in h which lead to g. Note that the erasures are made from a reduced expression
of g (one such can be gotten with the "compute" command); also, they could well
lead to an expression for h which is different from the one you entered, even
if that was reduced.
