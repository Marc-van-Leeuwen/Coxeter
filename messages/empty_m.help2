Command completion is enforced if the input string has a unique nonambiguous
completion (except in cases where this seemed inappropriate.)

Note that the program starts up in the so-called "empty" mode (the mode
it is in before type and rank are defined); most of the above commands
will be available only after you have entered type and rank. Even the help
information about them is initially unavailable, but will become available
as soon as you have entered a valid type and rank.

You can always type "help" whenever you have the prompt. This puts you
in help mode, where typing a command results in a brief description of its
workings.

Some commands put the program in a special "mode"; this is usually apparent
from the fact that the prompt changes. The idea is to avoid polluting the
global command space with rarely used names (or worse, with names that create
annoyance when typed by accident), and/or to allow some command names to
behave differently under certain circumstances. The typical example of this
is help mode. The modes function as a pushdown stack : on exiting a mode we
are put back in the mode where we came from.

A word about ranks. In principle the implementation of Coxeter groups allows
ranks up to 255, and coxeter matrix entries up to 32763 (or infinity). However,
for the convenience of the programmer and for efficiency reasons, currently we
have restricted the program to ranks at most equal to half the bit-size of an
unsigned long on your computer (this is usually 16 on a 32-bit computer, and
32 on a 64-bit one.) Particularly in view of the coming migration to 64 bits,
this seems to cover the main cases of interest. Also, if the program is unable
to construct the full minimal root table for lack of memory, it will quit.
Again, this is no limitation in practice.
