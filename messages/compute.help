The compute command prints out the normal form of an element. Moreover,
if the group has been classified as a SmallCoxGroup (this means that it
is finite, and that its order fits into an unsigned long), a representation
of the element as a single number (preceded by a # sign) is printed.
Otherwise, if the element lies in the current context for k-l computations,
its number in the context (preceded by a % sign) is printed. These numbers
are convenient as shorthand notations and may be used in input.

Note that the # number, when defined, is always the same; the % number, on
the other hand, may be session-dependent (it depends on how the context
has been built up.) It is even possible that the program decides to reorder
the context during a computation (this will happen only rarely, for very big
computations;) we will try to remember to print a warning like "warning :
% numbers may have changed" every time this occurs. Then you need to use
"compute" again to discover the new % number of your element.

Type "input" in help mode for a full description of the input rules.
