The pol command prints out a single polynomial P_{x,y}. You should enter
x as response to "first", y as response to "second". It is looked up in
the table if available, computed otherwise. As few k-l polynomials are
computed as possible, but all computed polynomials are remembered.

If you would like more detail about the computation, try "show".
