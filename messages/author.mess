A large part of the development work on this program was done while the
author was visiting the Centre de Recherches Mathematiques, Montreal,
and the University of British Columbia, Vancouver. Many thanks to both
institutions for their hospitality and in particular to Bill Casselman
who was the driving force in arranging both visits.
