In geometric language, the "sstratification" command prints out the irreducible
components of the strata in the singular locus of the Schubert variety X_y,
defined by the values of the Kazhdan-Lusztig polynomial P_{x,y}. In other
words, we look at the set of x < y such that P_{x,y} has a given value != 1,
and take the maximal elements in these sets. In the cases where there really
is a Schubert variety (i.e. for crystallographic Coxeter groups), it is known
that P_{x,y} is a coefficient-wise decreasing function of x. Note that the
ordering we use (the shortlex ordering on x) is precisely reversed from the
one that is used in Goresky's files.
