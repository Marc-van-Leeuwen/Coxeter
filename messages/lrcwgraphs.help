The "lrcwgraphs" command prints out the W-graphs of the two-sided cells in
the group. The cells are sorted in ShortLex order (for the current ordering
of the generators); this is the order in which they are output by the
"lrcells" command.

In the default output mode, the graphs are numbered by the number of the
corresponding cell in the above ordering; they are output in the default
format for W-graphs (one line per node, starting wtih the descent set,
and followed by the edge-list). See the help message for the "lrwgraph"
command for more details.
