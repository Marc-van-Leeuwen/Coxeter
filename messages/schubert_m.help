The program is currently in schubert mode. This is the mode in
which schubert cells are constructed, according to the algorithm
described in the introduction. Various functions for probing the
poset structure of the corresponding cell should eventually be
available in this mode; in this demo version, it is simply used
to set up the context for the computation of the kazhdan-lusztig
polynomials.
