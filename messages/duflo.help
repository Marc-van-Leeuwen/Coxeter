The "duflo" command prints out the Duflo (or distinguished) involutions in
the group. These are the unique elements in each left Kazhdan-Lusztig cell
for which the number l(d)-2*deg(P_{e,d}) is minimal; it turns out that they
are involutions. They are output in the same order as the one used for
left cells, i.e. by shortlex order of the shortlex-smallest element in the
cell, for the current ordering of the generators.
