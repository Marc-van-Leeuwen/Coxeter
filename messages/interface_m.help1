You are currently in interface mode; this is a "floating" mode meant for
changing either the ordering of the generators, or the appearance of the
output. You exit this mode by typing "q"; this will put you back where you

made at any time without penalty; all your previous computations will be
preserved. All changes are relative to the current group only; every new group
starts up with the default interface.

Commands available in this mode are :
