The command show takes as input two elements x and y in the group,
and prints out the various ingredients in the recursion formula for
P_{x,y}. This opens up the computations a little bit, and makes it
easier to understand what's going on. It's also very nice for the
purpose of following a computation step by step, say for debugging
purposes.

The generator is entered as "l" or "r" (depending on which side you want
it to act) followed by the current input symbol of your generator; if you
enter an empty string, the default descent generator is used. To find out
the descent set of your element, use "descent".
