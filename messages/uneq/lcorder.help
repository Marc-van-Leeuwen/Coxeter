The command "lcorder" prints out the ordering of the left cells for the
current group, for the current choice of parameters. This is by definition
the ordered set associated to the oriented graph which defines the left
preorder relation, where we have an arrow x->y if there exists an s in S
such that the coefficient of c_y in the product c_s.c_x is non-zero.

The output file contains a printout of the (dual) Hasse diagram of the
"abstract" poset, in the numbering of the vertices obtained by ordering
the cells in the shortLex order of their shortLex-smallest elements, for
the shortLex order corresponding to the current ordering of the vertices.
