The command "lrcorder" prints out the ordering of the two-sided cells
for the current group, for the current choice of parameters. This is by
definition the ordered set associated to the oriented graph which defines
the two-sided preorder relation, where we have an arrow x->y if there exists
an s in S such that the coefficient of c_y in the product c_s.c_x or in the
product c_x.c_s is non-zero.

The output file contains a printout of the (dual) Hasse diagram of the
"abstract" poset, in the numbering of the vertices obtained by ordering
the cells in the shortLex order of their shortLex-smallest elements, for
the shortLex order corresponding to the current ordering of the vertices.
