The command "mu" prints out the mu-coefficient mu(s,x,y) for a generator s
and two given elements x and y in the group; x should be entered in response
to "first", y in response to "second". The generator should be entered as
'l' or 'r' (depending on whether left or right action is desired), followed
by one of the current generator symbols. The result is undefined unless x < y,
ys > y and xs < x.

The result is looked up in the table if available, computed otherwise. The
computation of k-l polynomials is avoided as much as possible.
